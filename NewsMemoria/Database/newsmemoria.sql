He pledged to work toward national reconciliation, strive for peace with warring ethnic rebels and improving the lives of Myanmar''s 54 million people.'),
(58, 1011, 'While it was a historic day for the impoverished Southeast Asian country, democracy remains incomplete. The military retains considerable power in the government and parliament, and the president himself will play second fiddle to Suu Kyi. She cannot be president because of a constitutional manipulation engineered by the military, and has repeatedly said she will run the country from behind the scenes.'),
(59, 1011, '"I am very happy that we have a president who represents people," said Mar Thin, a 50-year-old street cleaner.

(63, 1011, '"Burma will face significant challenges going forward, including achieving broad-based economic development, advancing national reconciliation, and promoting the rights and freedoms of all its people," Mr. Obama said. "The United States looks forward to being a friend and partner of the new government and the people of Burma as they make progress toward building a more inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous future."'),
(64, 1011, 'The U.S. Government has continued, under most circumstances, to refer to the country as Burma as it was the former military junta that unilaterally changed the name to Myanmar in 1989. The U.S. position is that the Burmese people should have been the ones to make the decision on a name change, not the regime. U.S. officials do, however, use the name Myanmar in international venues and in Myanmar itself.'),
(65, 1011, 'The official U.S. stance on the name could change, the White House says, depending on which word the new government shows a preference for.'),
(66, 1011, 'Htin Kyaw''s swearing-in was held in an austere hall of parliament, with lawmakers dressed in traditional costume. A few hours later, outgoing President Thein Sein shook hands with his successor and handed him a letter and a golden sash, officially transferring power.'),

(69, 1011, 'Suu Kyi endured decades of house arrest and harassment by military rulers without ever giving up on her nonviolent campaign to unseat them. The constitutional clause that denied her the presidency excludes anyone from the position who has a foreign spouse or child. Suu Kyi''s two sons are British, as was her late husband. The clause is widely seen as having been written by the military with Suu Kyi in mind.'),
(70, 1011, 'She has repeatedly made it clear that she will run the government from behind the scenes, and in his speech on Wednesday, Htin Kyaw paid obeisance to Suu Kyi.'),
(71, 1011, '"The new parliament and new government are formed in accord with the policies of the National League for Democracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi," he said, and referred to the party''s goal to amend the constitution.'),
(72, 1011, '"I have the obligation to work toward achieving a constitution that has democratic norms and is suitable for the nation," Htin Kyaw said.

(73, 1011, 'How has Burma changed since CBS News'' Bill Whitaker was last there in 1990?'),
(74, 1011, 'The constitution, drafted under the former junta, reserves 25 percent of the seats in parliament for military officers, guaranteeing that no government can amend the constitution without the army''s approval. The military also heads the Home Ministry, the Border Affairs Ministry and the Defense Ministry, which gives it control over the corrections department, ensuring that the release of political prisoners is its decision to make.'),
(75, 1011, 'The military also ensured that one of Htin Kyaw''s two vice presidents is a former general, Myint Swe, a close ally of former junta leader Than Shwe. Myint Swe remains on a U.S. Treasury Department blacklist that bars American companies from doing business with several tycoons and senior military figures connected with the former junta.'),
(76, 1011, 'As Htin Kyaw was sworn in, Suu Kyi sat in the front row watching. The same pledge was simultaneously read by First Vice President Myint Swe and Second Vice President Henry Van Tio. After a 20-minute tea break, the 18 members of Htin Kyaw''s Cabinet, including Suu Kyi, took a joint oath of office read out by the speaker.'),
(77, 1011, 'Suu Kyi''s leadership of four ministries is unusual, and the lack of public criticism of her wide power is likely a sign of her continuing broad support.'),
(78, 1011, 'Despite her inability to become president, Suu Kyi''s entry into the government is a remarkable turn of fortune not only for her, but also for the country, which had been under iron-fisted military rule for decades beginning in 1962. The junta kept Myanmar in isolation and economic stagnation while refusing to listen to international counsel or homegrown demands for democracy.'),
(79, 1011, 'Suu Kyi came to prominence in 1988, when popular protests were building up. The junta crushed the protests, which had turned into anti-government riots, killing thousands of people and placing Suu Kyi under house arrest in 1989.'),
(80, 1011, 'The junta called elections in 1990, but refused to hand over power when Suu Kyi''s party won overwhelmingly. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize a year later while under house arrest.'),
(81, 1011, 'The junta finally started loosening its grip on power in 2010, allowing elections that were won by a military-allied party after Suu Kyi''s party boycotted the polls as unfair. Thein Sein, a former general, was installed as president for a five-year term that started March 30, 2011, and ended Wednesday.'),

(88, 874, '"I know I''m not the only one who may be more than a little dismayed about what''s happening on the campaign trail right now -- the divisive and often vulgar rhetoric that''s aimed at everybody but often is focused on the vulnerable or women or minorities," he said.'),
(89, 874, 'Some may be more to blame than others, the president said, but all of us are responsible for reversing it.'),
(90, 874, 'Mr. Obama spoke at the presentation of the Toner Prize, named for Robin Toner, the first woman to be national political correspondent for The New York Times. During her nearly 25 years there, Toner covered five presidential campaigns. She passed away in 2008.'),
(91, 874, 'The president said the number one question he gets when traveling the world is "What is happening in America?" He said it''s because people abroad understand America is the place where you "can''t afford completely crazy politics," and they care about the most powerful nation on earth functioning effectively.'),
(92, 874, '"We are all invested in making this system work. We are all responsible for its success, and it''s not just for the United States that this matters, it matters for the planet," Mr. Obama said.'),

(95, 874, 'Obama called on the broadcast networks and producers to give reporters room to follow their instincts and dig deeper. He said Toner proved that something can be substantive and interesting. He said elections to her were not a horse race, or about scoring the most political points, but were about issues.'),
(96, 874, '"A job well done is about more than just handing someone a microphone. It''s to probe and to question and to dig deeper and to demand more," the president said. "The electorate would be better served if that happened. It would be better served if billions of dollars in free media came with serious accountability, especially when politicians issue unworkable plans or make promises they cannot keep."'),
(97, 874, 'He says he understands there are pressures "to feed the beast" with more gossipy, softer stories, but that leads to consumers failing to understand the world as well as they should, which has consequences for the country.'),

(207, 426, 'The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, stepped in as a partner and agreed to provide the Proton rockets to get ExoMars off the ground. The Russians contributed some of the instruments in the scientific payload for ExoMars 2016, but the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and the landing capsule Schiaparelli were largely European products, Reiter said. Roscosmos will have a much bigger role in 2018 —which will require a lot more technical and industrial coordination between the partners.'),
(208, 426, '"The carrier module and the rover will be built in Europe, but the lander is a Russian product,"Reiter said. "That means that the cooperation between the Russian industry and the European industry will significantly intensify."'),

(221, 426, 'But Mars'' atmosphere isn''t thick enough to slow down spacecraft so that they don''t crash. To put Schiaparelli—and eventually, a rover — on Mars, ESA will use a combination of a heat shield, a big parachute and landing engines, all of which need to work perfectly in a daunting sequence of events that Bayle explained here in a presentation.'),
(223, 426, 'Schiaparelli will separate from TGO three days before reaching Mars. Then, it will go into hibernation mode to save its battery life, only waking up an hour before landing.

(1273, 1168, 'SOHO experienced a "loss of attitude control, subsequent loss of telemetry, and loss of power and thermal control," the board said. This meant that the people on the ground could not control SOHO and could not get any information about its status. Worse, the spacecraft was spinning in such a way that it was being heated unevenly; also, SOHO''s solar panels could not recharge its batteries.'),
(1274, 1168, 'Worried controllers spent a month sending signals to the spacecraft and waiting in vain for a response. In July, they found SOHO by using a large radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. The radar echoes off of SOHO showed the spacecraft was spinning.'),

(1278, 1168, 'Carefully, controllers thawed out SOHO''s frozen fuel inside of its thrusters and recharged the batteries. By mid-September, SOHO was once again pointing in the right direction. Two of the three gyroscopes had failed, but the rest of its instruments appeared to be fine.'),
(1279, 1168, 'On Dec. 21, 1998, however, the last gyroscope broke. Controllers used hydrazine fuel in the thrusters to keep SOHO pointed in the right direction, but they were using quite a bit of it — 15 pounds (7 kilograms) a week, on average.'),
(1280, 1168, 'In January, SOHO controllers changed the spacecraft''s software so that it could operate without gyroscopes and use other tools on the spacecraft to figure out its attitude. This reduced fuel usage and allowed normal observations to continue.'),

(1284, 1168, 'Five years after SOHO''s launch, it was already altering our view of how the sun worked. In 2001, ESA announced that SOHO researchers were giving storm watchers an extra week''s notice of eruption risks. One spacecraft instrument can see through the sun to the backside, while another one can sense activity through ultraviolet emissions.'),
(1285, 1168, 'Also, SOHO saw the sun get brighter as sunspot activity increased, watched gas currents whisk below the sun''s surface, and analyzed the elements coming out of the "solar wind" — the continuous stream of particles from the sun that bleed into space.'),
(1286, 1168, 'Perhaps its most important discovery was probing how coronal mass ejections (large amounts of ionized gas) form a space "highway" that sends energetic particles through space. The more we know about these particles, the better able we''ll be to protect astronauts and infrastructure such as power grids.'),

The two systems should have their first flight test together in 2018, when SLS will propel Orion into space for an uncrewed flight around the moon. (Riding along with Orion will be 13 CubeSats to explore deep space.) Human flights are expected by 2023, although a 2021 launch date is possible.'),
(1367, 1160, 'The Solar Dynamics Observatory is a NASA spacecraft launched in 2010, in time to catch sunspot and solar activity at its peak in 2013 as a part of the sun''s 11-year cycle.'),
(1368, 1160, 'The satellite spends 24 hours a day, seven days a week staring at the sun, recording high-definition views of the sun''s atmosphere in detail never seen previously.'),
(1369, 1160, 'In addition to simply observing the sun, NASA is using this observatory to get better at predicting solar activity. SDO aims to provide insights on the structure of the sun''s magnetic field, as well as how energy is transferred from the sun into space.'),
(1370, 1160, 'So far, SDO has captured high-resolution views of solar flares, provided more information on predicting magnetic activity, and even captured a planet going across the face of the sun (from the perspective of Earth.)'),
(1373, 1160, 'SDO is the first of NASA''s Living With a Star program probes. The sun is an invaluable source of energy and warmth for the planet, but its variability can at time cause problems. A large solar storm has the capability to knock out power lines or communications satellites, for example. The program''s major goal, therefore, is to understand why the sun''s energy varies and how it can affect Earth.'),
(1374, 1160, 'One instrument on board is the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, which can record pictures of the sun in IMAX resolution. With high-definition images available in most of the 10 available wavelengths every 10 seconds, it allows scientists to watch over the corona and see any changes — no matter what temperature. The continual observations were expected to yield more information on the causes of solar flares and coronal eruptions.'),
(1375, 1160, 'The other instruments are the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, which can track electric currents and magnetic activity in the corona, and the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment, which monitors ultraviolet solar emissions.'),
(1376, 1160, 'The spacecraft originally had a five-year life span, but has lasted beyond an 11-year solar cycle, and was still performing well as of early 2016.'),
(1379, 1160, 'SDO cost $850 million to construct and launch. The satellite was lofted into space Feb. 11, 2010, aboard an Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. From there, the satellite was placed in an inclined geosynchronous orbit that traces a figure-eight path every day above the Earth as it watches the sun.'),
(1380, 1160, '"SDO''s inclined geosynchronous orbit was chosen to allow continuous observations of the Sun and enable its exceptionally high data rate through the use of a single dedicated ground station," stated the Solar Dynamics Observatory website.'),
(1381, 1160, 'Controllers were astounded at what SDO produced in its first year of observations, particularly its views of the sun''s corona. Normally that portion of the sun is best visible during eclipses, but with SDO, scientists were able to watch what the corona was doing from its tip to the sun''s surface.'),
(1382, 1160, '"The science is really ramping up and it''s very exciting to find out all the capabilities of the instruments," Phil Chamberlin, SDO deputy project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., told SPACE.com in 2011.'),

(1386, 1160, 'As the sun moved toward solar maximum in 2013, SDO''s capabilities really began to shine for astronomers. A May solar flare was captured in high resolution, with pictures in multiple wavelengths showing the extent of the prominence eruption. The flare, though, was considered medium-sized, meaning that more spectacular eruptions could come before the cameras.'),
(1387, 1160, 'With SDO''s eye on the sun, anything that passes in front of it could also be captured by camera. A notable example was Venus, which transited across the sun (from Earth''s perspective) June 5-6, 2012. The event is predictable but extremely rare; the transit before was in 2004, but the next one won''t occur until 2117.'),
(1388, 1160, 'That same year, SDO captured a solar "tornado" that was five times wider than Earth, moving across the sun''s surface — in both images and video. At the time, NASA said this was likely the first time a video had been caught of the activity.'),
(1389, 1160, 'The tornado was shaped by the sun''s magnetic field; Earth''s, by contrast, occur due to wind activity. It also moved a lot faster; scientists estimated the sun''s tornado whirled at up to 186,000 mph (300,000 kph), while an Earth storm typically goes no faster than about 300 mph (483 kph).'),
(1390, 1160, 'More of these plasma ''tornadoes'' have been captured by SDO, such as one that occurred in late 2015. Observing events such as this gives scientists more insight into the underlying mechanisms of the sun''s plasma production.'),
(1391, 1160, 'SDO''s long-term observations of the sun also show scientists when something different is happening. For example, in June 2011 there was a coronal mass ejection that ejected an immense amount of plasma, or superheated gas. Scientists in 2014 published results saying they observed the plasma splitting into "fingers" of matter in a similar way that has been observed in the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant. This was an unusual opportunity to study what is known as the Rayleigh-Taylor phenomenon on a large scale.'),
(1392, 1160, 'Also in 2014, scientists observed magnetic field lines looping and causing an eruption in the sun''s atmosphere. The high-resolution footage captured by SDO confirmed a theory that had been held for years. These sorts of observations will make it easier to predict where large flares happen, which could better protect infrastructure on Earth, scientists said at the time.'),
(1393, 1160, 'SDO had a popular chicken mascot called Camilla Corona SDO, who regularly attended NASA Social events and even once took a balloon ride to the end of space. The mascot was reassigned to more general public relations work in 2013.'),

(1398, 1248, 'Located approximately 1,500 lightyears from Earth in the constellation Orion, the Horsehead Nebula is simple to spot due to its unique shape resembling a horse''s head. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, or about 6 trillion miles (10 trillion kilometers). The star seen just above the Flame nebula is Alnitak. [Gallery: Strange Nebula Shapes - What Do YOU See?]'),
(1399, 1248, 'The Horsehead nebula is also called Barnard 33 in emission nebula IC 434 and is part of a large, dark molecular cloud. It was first spotted in 1888 by astronomers at the Harvard College Observatory, who imaged the nebula using a telescope and photographic plates.'),

(1453, 294, 'They may have taken very different roads to arrive at their current jobs, but many of NASA''s top female administrators have at least one thing in common: They have shared the experience of being a woman in a male-dominated field.'),
(1454, 294, 'On March 16, these top NASA leaders shared their experiences with a crowd of female high school students at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The event, held in partnership with the White House Council on Women and Girls, was part of Women''s History Month, and featured a panel of speakers that included Ellen Ochoa, former space shuttle astronaut and current director of NASA''s Johnson Space Center; Lesa Roe, NASA''s deputy associate administrator; Ellen Stofan, NASA''s chief scientist; and Dava Newman, the agency''s deputy administrator.'),
(1455, 294, 'At the event, the four women shared the stories of how they found their way to NASA, and their individual stories reflect four very different personalities. [Women in Space: A Space History Gallery]'),
(1456, 294, 'As chief scientist, Stofan holds the most senior science position at NASA. She knew she wanted to be a geologist from an early age. "I was the kid that was always picking up rocks," Stofan said. She disliked math in high school but persevered because she knew she needed knowledge in this subject to become a scientist.'),
(1457, 294, 'Ochoa, on the other hand, loved math — she took her college''s entire series of calculus courses "for fun" — but changed her major "about five times," thinking she might study music or journalism. It wasn''t until she finished the calculus classes that she realized she might like to pursue physics. In her first year of graduate school, she saw NASA launch the space shuttle program and accept the first women astronauts, and later decided to apply for the program.'),
(1458, 294, 'Newman, who holds the second-highest position at NASA, said she wanted to be a "sports lawyer" in high school but gradually found her way to aerospace engineering, largely because she felt space exploration was a way to promote international peace and cooperation.'),
(1459, 294, 'For Roe, a trip to a community college career center during high school made her consider going into engineering. But it wasn''t until her time as an undergraduate, when she enrolled in a co-op program and was able to work at a NASA center every other semester, that she understood that "this is what engineers do and I love it."'),
(1460, 294, 'Those personal stories reflect the preferences and personalities of four very different women, who ultimately arrived in NASA''s upper echelon via different paths. And yet all four women shared the experience of being the only (or perhaps "one of two") women in most of their science and engineering classes in undergraduate and graduate school.'),
(1461, 294, 'All four speakers said this trend continued beyond school. Newman said she was one of the first female faculty members at a school where she taught and was later one of the only female faculty members in her department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Roe was the first female director of NASA''s Langley Research Center in Virginia, a position she took up in 2005.'),
(1462, 294, 'Once again, the women''s differences became apparent when they talked about how that experience made them feel and how they dealt with it.'),
(1463, 294, '"It''s changed a lot throughout my career," Ochoa said. "It was harder when I was young. In college and graduate school and early on in my career, I was often the only woman in a class or one of two. And I felt self-conscious. I felt like I stood out. It made me a little bit reluctant to raise my hand and ask a question."'),
(1464, 294, 'Ochoa said she began going to her professors'' office hours to ask questions, which ended up boosting her confidence because those teachers were eager to talk to her.'),
(1465, 294, '"I don''t really notice I''m a woman in the room, because I''m a member of the team," Roe said. "In electrical engineering and in college, I was often the only woman in the room, and it''s more in hindsight that I remember it. When I was in the room, it might just be a real quick thought, but it didn''t faze me in any way. And within NASA, I''ve always been one on the team. I''ve been one of the people getting the job done."'),
(1466, 294, 'Roe said she''s known women who feel more confident stepping into a job if they have seen another women hold the role before them. However, "I never did," she added. "I never thought about it that way. For me, it really hasn''t been a barrier or anything."'),
(1467, 294, 'Stofan, on the other hand, said her struggle to feel like part of the team had more to do with other people''s isolating comments.'),
(1468, 294, '"Sometimes, especially early in my career, I would feel like I was one of the team and I was just like everybody else," she said. "And then, one of the men would make a comment that would make me stop and think, ''Oh yeah, the rest of the people in the room don''t look like me.'' And they would make me feel like, ''Oh yeah, you''re a girl.'''),
(1469, 294, '"So, a lot of times, especially early in my career, when I wasn''t self-confident, I would feel like, ''I have to work twice as hard just to be taken half as seriously.'' But as I got more confident, I realized, ''They actually need me here,''" Stofan added.'),
(1470, 294, 'Stofan said that, for inspiration, she thought about people like Katherine Johnson, an African American woman who began working for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NASA''s predecessor) starting in 1953 and did critical work on the Mercury program in the 1960s. She retired from NASA in 1986, and earned multiple awards and honorary degrees for her work. In 2016, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the U.S.'),
(1471, 294, '"[As] an African American woman in the early 1960s, a lot of the time, [Johnson] was not made to feel welcome in the room," Stofan said. "But she has said in interviews, ''I knew I belonged there.'''),
(1472, 294, '"Channel your inner Katherine Johnson," Stofan advised the high school students. "If anybody ever makes you feel like you don''t belong in that room, remember her, and say, ''I''m going to be like Katherine Johnson, and I''m going to feel like I belong — because I do, and they need me here to get this work done.''"'),
(1473, 294, 'Prior to the panel discussion, Jo Handelsman, associate director for science at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, held a separate discussion. In the talk, she discussed changes that should take place in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, to help increase the number of women and minorities who choose to study science and who continue on into science-related careers.'),
(1474, 294, '"The first thing we have to do is change the way we teach STEM in the classroom — and that''s throughout, from kindergarten all the way through graduate school," Handelsman said. The changes include making STEM lessons more hands-on and engaging, such as including activities that let students create and engineer things, and "not just reading in a textbook about things that other people have discovered or invented," she said. '),
(1475, 294, '"Those are good teaching techniques for everyone, but they have a differentially positive effect on women and minorities," Handelsman continued. She added that women and minorities are more likely to seek careers that focus on real-world problems, either in their community or on a global scale. Thus, students need to see the connection between STEM careers and solving those types of problems, she said.'),
(1476, 294, 'The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is focused on changing the way STEM and the people who do STEM are represented in the media, Handelsman said, and a movie about the life of Katherine Johnson is in the works.'),
(1477, 294, 'Ochoa wrapped up her comments on the panel by talking about one of her responsibilities at Johnson Space Center, which is to make recommendations for nominees for the National Medal of Technology and Innovation.'),
(1478, 294, '"One of the criteria is that the [invention] needs to have made a major impact on society," Ochoa said. Because inventions and innovations often take decades to make an impact on the world, many of the nominations Ochoa said she reads are for work done about 30 or more years ago.'),
(1479, 294, '"Because of that, very few of the people that we read about are women," Ochoa said. "And I always sit there and think, ''Well, I certainly hope that, as we''re doing this 20 or 30 years from now, we''ll see a lot more women who have been involved in inventions that have now grown into companies or products that have a great impact on society.''"'),

(1484, 238, '"I am not advocating a cut to NASA," Bolden said in response to questions about the agency''s budget request from subcommittee chairman Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas). "We are advocating a $19 billion budget and, to be quite honest, the reason it wasn''t $19.3 [billion] was because we had no idea that the ''16 budget was going to be $19.3.

(1486, 238, '"I always request more money than we get," Bolden said later in the hearing. "Had we known that the Congress was going to appropriate $19.3 billion, I would have been comfortable going in and asking for even more than we asked for."'),
(1487, 238, 'Bolden, testifying for the third time in a week, faced similar questions about NASA''s budget request from committee members. That included criticism from both Republican and Democratic members about reductions in spending for the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft.'),

(1490, 238, 'Bolden, as he did in previous hearings, said that the administration''s request supported a first crewed SLS/Orion mission no later than 2023, but with the possibility of launching as soon as 2021. Bolden, though, sought to downplay an earlier launch for that mission.'),
(1491, 238, '"I want to get people away from focusing on an earlier date, because that does bring concerns about safety," he said, citing concerns raised by the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel in its report earlier this year. "2023 is a great date."'),
(1492, 238, 'Some members also criticized reductions in planetary science spending versus increases in NASA''s Earth science program, as well as the use of mandatory funds to get around discretionary spending caps, issued raised in previous hearings by Senate appropriators March 10 and House appropriators March 15.'),
(1493, 238, 'The hearing was also one of the last times Bolden is expected to testify before Congress. At the hearing, as at previous ones, Bolden mentioned that this budget request is "likely my final budget," an indication that he does not plan to remain in office when a new administration takes office next January.'),
(1494, 238, 'Members used the hearing to heap accolades on Bolden. "Let me compliment Administrator Bolden, because I think he is a committed public servant.

(1657, 450, 'Siegler and his team think they have figured out where this mass shift on the moon occurred. Their work points to the Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT) region on the lunar nearside, which was volcanically active long ago.

As heat from the impact penetrated the surface, salts and volatile elements such as water would have been heated and mixed. As the liquid material evaporated, it could have left salts behind to twinkle at the surface. But Occator is about 80 million years old, and bright material should not have lasted nearly that long on the surface, researchers said.'),

They also looked at changes in Martian gravity — which is about one-third that of Earth''s gravity — over 11 years (the same as the sun''s cycle of activity). An examination of these changes gave them new insights into how much of the polar ice cap''s carbon dioxide freezes out of the atmosphere during winter.

(1828, 354, 'So we (and "we" here means both scientists and the public) have a problem: the knowledge that scientists gain about the natural world stays relatively locked up within the scientific community, the scientists have no incentive to share it more broadly, and the public grows ever more distrustful of scientists.

This is why I started working with Seven Dance Company to create "Song of the Stars." By sharing what I know with dancers and choreographers, we''re working together to translate mathematics and jargon into new languages and use those new languages to tell stories that connect with us in different, emotional ways. This process sacrifices technical details, which is fine. I''m trying to communicate intuition, not information. If an audience wants reams of complex text and mathematics, they''re already well-served.'),

Many people are immediately "turned off" by science or space concepts. But maybe dance can reach them. Maybe other artistic expressions can communicate to them. Maybe if science is shared with them in a way that they can appreciate and enjoy, we can break the cycle of distrust. Maybe if science knowledge is presented in new ways — away from meaningless soundbites or contextless data points — audiences can gain an understanding of, and an appreciation for, what scientists do.'),

If that curiosity can be awakened — or reawakened — maybe the next time scientists beg the public for money they won''t be immediately dismissed.

The assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King in 1968. The riots in Chicago in 1968. There was a lot of tension in America at that time, and the space program was a shining example of what we could do if we really set our hearts and our minds to a gargantuan task.

(1917, 663, '"Because [the sites in the book] really have become archaeological sites in many ways, and I think, just at a base level, I was just trying to preserve them in this state of their existence," he added. "There are obviously thousands of photographs of these facilities while they were active. I wanted to show how they''ve evolved and what had happened, and I do think there is that sense of loss."'),
(1918, 663, 'Many of Miller''s images try to convey the massive scale of these former launch sites and facilities, and those images cannot help but simultaneously illustrate the desertion that surrounds these locations. There are no cars, no lights on; and weeds poke through the cracked pavement. But more of the images in the book focus on smaller details. They closely examine the decay that is taking place, and frequently capture the unintentional beauty that has arisen from that decay. '),
(1919, 663, 'One photograph zooms in on a "plug board" (it looks sort of like an old telephone switchboard, with wires connecting different peg holes in some indecipherable pattern) from the Redstone Launch Complex 26 Blockhouse. It''s framed so that nothing else around it can be seen, and it''s easy to imagine the people who focused so intently on it, and arranged those wires in just the right way. It looks frozen, rather than abandoned, like someone''s hand might move into view at any moment and move one of the cables.'),
(1920, 663, '"I took what I refer to as a dual approach to the subject matter because, at some level, it has to be documentary in nature," Miller said. "There are a lot of overall shots where you see the whole pad or good portion of the structure, but I also wanted to photograph the nuances, the smaller details, the more abstract things, if you will — things you wouldn''t necessarily notice.'),
(1921, 663, '"I think, when people think of a launchpad; they think of the whole thing," he said. "They think of the tower and the mobile service tower, but they don''t really think about the details. So, to tell a fuller story, I made a very concerted effort to [do that]. Plus, there are so many visually interesting things going on when you get down to that detail level. It''s actually one of the unusual things about the project … People tend to do one or the other, not both. And I took some grief at the beginning of the project for doing that, and I''m glad I stuck with it because I think it''s one of the more important aspects of it."'),
(1922, 663, 'Paired with the photographs are essays by Miller, as well as a handful of essays written by people with very different connections to the space program.'),
(1923, 663, '"I approached quite a number of people I knew in the space industry — and I guess it was one of the happy accidents, because these were the folks that responded and said, ''Yeah, I''d like to do that,''" Miller said.'),
(1924, 663, '"I think it actually fit very well with the flow of the book to have an art historian write the introduction and kind of describe the history of space and art," Miller said, referring to Betsy Fahlman, a professor of art history at Arizona State University. Craig Covault, an aerospace journalist who has "covered every U.S. space launch since Apollo," according to a statement from the book''s publisher, wrote an essay about Launch Complexes 40 and 41, two locations that had great significance in the early days of human spaceflight and that have been repurposed for new phases of human spaceflight.'),
(1925, 663, 'Col. Pamela Melroy, a former NASA astronaut and space shuttle commander, penned an essay about Launch Complex 34 for the book. In the essay, she touches on one of the great tragedies of NASA''s human spaceflight program: It was on that launchpad that the Apollo 1 capsule caught fire during a test exercise, killing all three men inside. Melroy mentions in the essay her work on the Columbia reconstruction team — the group tasked with sifting through the wreckage of the shuttle that was destroyed on its way back to Earth.'),
(1926, 663, '"[Complex 34] became a touchstone for her during that very, very difficult work," Miller said. "She came up with a beautiful essay regarding how that site affected her. And I think [her essay] is a tribute to all the fallen astronauts."'),
(1927, 663, 'The book''s title, "Abandoned in Place," is one that resonates with people who visit these old sites. Ray Bradbury wrote a poem about this phrase, and Miller chose to place it at the very beginning of the book. In the poem''s final lines, Bradbury urged, "Old ghosts of rocketmen, arise. Fling up your ships, your souls, your flesh, your blood/Your blinding dreams/To fill, refill, and fill again/Tomorrow and tomorrow wand tomorrow''s/Promised and re-promised/Skies."'),

(1931, 1176, 'COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — This week, the 32nd Space Symposium took place in Colorado, but it might as well have been at Cape Canaveral. A virtual-reality app created by United Launch Alliance (ULA) dropped me onto a launchpad next to a Delta IV rocket, and watching it take off gave me nearly the same thrill as seeing a launch in person.'),
(1932, 1176, 'Humans should never actually get as close to a rocket launch as I got to the Delta IV rocket that took off in the VR app. Cameras positioned at three different positions on or near the launchpad captured the explosive column of fire that erupted from the bottom of the rocket, and headphones blasted the booming sound. It was astounding to see the details of the rocket body and the pillar flame up close. Two of the cameras were quickly overwhelmed by smoke, but a third let me look up at the rocket as it became a smaller and smaller point of light overhead.'),
(1933, 1176, 'The VR app is for the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset, which provides a 3D, 360-degree view of the launch, meaning the user can "look around" while the video plays. Even though I knew I was just looking at a video, the responsiveness of the system to the movement of my head quickly suspended my disbelief.'),
(1934, 1176, 'The ULA app is available for download from the company''s website. Users who don''t want to buy a VR headset can use Google Cardboard, which is an assemble-it-yourself cardboard VR headset (smartphone required). It''s obviously less impressive than an actual VR headset, but much, much less expensive.'),
(1935, 1176, 'ULA wasn''t the only booth with a VR experience — Lockheed Martin also had a short VR tour of the facility where the Orion capsule is loaded onto a specially designed airplane called the "Super Guppy." Additionally, Lockheed Martin had a virtual-reality game in which players navigate a Mars rover along the surface of the Red Planet, trying to reach specific locations without tipping over the rover. Another game lets the user walk around a section of the Martian surface. The company is involved in the development of some very advanced virtual-reality tech, and is trying to use VR as part of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education and outreach. However, the programs we saw at the Space Symposium are not currently available to the public.'),
(1936, 1176, 'However, anyone who wants to take a virtual tour of the Red Planet should consider visiting the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex this summer — the facility is opening a new exhibit called "Destination: Mars," in which visitors don VR headsets that give them a 3D, 360-degree virtual-reality view of the surface of Mars, created using real images taken by Red Planet rovers. Plus, the Red Planet tour is led by a VR projection of Buzz Aldrin! In addition, the exhibit will have a space where visitors (wearing the headsets) can walk around, making it seem as though they are really walking around on the surface of Mars.');

(2958, 863, 'Because Democrats'' delegates are allocated proportionally throughout the entire primary season, just winning some of these states won''t be enough: Sanders needs to win by massive margins, the same kind of margins he won by in the caucus states last Saturday.

(3876, 1192, 'The group outlined the technologies it needs to develop and test, none of which are particularly exotic.

(3882, 1192, 'Then there''s the interstellar medium. Space isn''t completely empty, and moving a spacecraft, even a tiny one, through the interstellar and interplanetary medium at a sizable fraction of light speed has never been done.'),
(3883, 1192, '"The interstellar medium isn''t zero," McDowell said, meaning that the probes might hit something.'),
(3884, 1192, 'The Starshot probes would be traveling 4,000 times faster than NASA''s New Horizons Pluto spacecraft, which is the fastest thing that humans have launched to date. At such speeds, colliding with even the smallest bits of matter could be disastrous.'),
(3885, 1192, '"A hydrogen atom moving that fast is a cosmic ray," McDowell said, referring to superenergetic particles accelerated to tremendous speeds by supernova explosions. "Electronics don''t like that."'),
(3887, 1192, 'Even spacecraft shielded against cosmic rays can still be damaged by them, as happened to NASA''s Dawn spacecraft in 2014 during its journey to the dwarf planet Ceres.'),
(3888, 1192, 'Furthermore, a particle the size of a sand grain would deliver the same energy to a Starshot probe as a pound (0.5 kilograms) of TNT, potentially destroying the tiny spacecraft entirely, McDowell said. During the Tuesday presentation, Worden said this problem is mitigated by the sheer size and relative emptiness of space, which makes the odds relatively small that the probes will hit anything. In addition, hundreds or thousands of Starshot probes would probably be launched to each interstellar destination, so losing a few wouldn''t be a big deal, team members said.'),
(3889, 1192, 'Another issue will be the acceleration. Starshot probes will be pushed to their cruising speed in about 2 minutes, absorbing a G-force of about 51,000. Electronics are fairly robust, but none have been tested under those conditions, McDowell said. (For perspective, NASA''s Apollo astronauts endured between 3 and 7 G''s when returning to Earth from their moon missions.)'),
(3890, 1192, 'Finally, there are the challenges posed by building a laser big and powerful enough to push the spacecraft to such tremendous speeds. The laser would be a type called a phased array, which involves using lots of lasing elements to create a single combined beam that can be steered without needing a huge mechanical apparatus.'),
(3891, 1192, 'The various elements can also be fired to shape the emitted light waves the laser emits. The technique is common in radar systems, said Starshot advisor Philip Lubin, a physics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has researched building large laser systems.'),
(3892, 1192, '"We can learn a lot from that," Lubin said of such prior research. But he acknowledged that nobody has built a phased-array laser on a Starshot-level scale before.'),
(3893, 1192, 'Lubin said the Starshot array would be composed of thousands of meter-sized (3.3 feet) optical elements and would cover an area approaching several square miles. It would require on the order of 200 gigawatts to operate. That''s 50 times the power generated by the largest nuclear plant in the United States.'),
(3894, 1192, 'However, the laser wouldn''t be firing continuously, and would probably run off some kind of power storage such as a huge capacitor or battery, firing for only a fraction of the time, Starshot team members said. So the power for any given use could be cut to 20 GW, Starshot team members said on Tuesday.'),
(3896, 1192, 'A phased array is attractive because going with a traditional laser would require a single massive optical system, Lubin said.'),
(3897, 1192, '"That''s much more horrendous to do," he said.'),
(3898, 1192, 'The laser array would also function as the receiver for communications from the Starshot probes, which would beam home images and other scientific data from their flybys of Alpha Centauri and other faraway systems. (Each tiny spacecraft would be equipped with a tiny laser-communication system that would likely be powered by a small radioisotope battery, like the ones in smoke detectors, Worden said.)'),
(3899, 1192, 'There are other issues related to the laser, too. One is that the plan calls for building the laser on the ground rather than in space. That means that the beam will ionize the air around it, which could interfere with the beam itself and create massive amounts of ozone, McDowell said.'),
(3900, 1192, '"The environmental-impact statement will be interesting," he said.'),
(3901, 1192, 'Another issue is Earth-orbiting satellites, many of which can''t be steered and might get in the way of the laser beam. They might therefore be damaged, or create interference, McDowell said.'),
(3902, 1192, 'But this isn''t necessarily an insoluble problem.'),
(3903, 1192, '"Maybe there''s a way to time it," McDowell said, referring to the firing of the laser.'),

"(Scientists) had expected to see cold, dead places, but right away they were blown away by their striking surfaces," said Christine McCarthy, of Columbia University who carried out research into Europa''s ices while a graduate student at Brown University. "There was clearly some sort of tectonic activity — things moving around and cracking. There were also places on Europa that look like melt-through or mushy ice."'),
(3948, 1128, 'It is now known that Europa possesses an extensive sub-surface ocean of water, protected by a fragmented, icy crust that appears to move much like the continental plates on Earth. Tidal pressures created during Europa''s orbit around Jupiter create an internal dynamo, which gently heats the moon from the core, maintaining the ocean in a liquid state. In addition, the motion of the icy plates are thought to generate their own heat through frictional processes at the boundaries. Much like the heat produced when repeatedly bending a wire coat hanger, heat is dissipated through the repeated tidal flexing of Europa''s crust at these boundaries.'),

(3953, 1128, 'Until now, it has been assumed that the majority of heating comes from friction between individual ice grains, so that would suggest the frictional heating is directly related to the size of the grains.

Instead, she realized that the bulk of the heating comes from microscopic defects in the ice''s crystalline structure as the ice was deformed.

[See how the system works in this video]'),
(8005, 3226, 'Specifically, NASA is working on improvements to very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), a technique that allows multiple radio telescopes to work together simultaneously to make more precise measurements.'),
(8006, 3226, 'A signal from a radio-emitting object, such as a quasar (the region around a galaxy''s central supermassive black hole), is collected by several telescopes. Then, researchers calculate the distance between the telescopes by comparing the times at which the radio signal arrived at different receivers. The new system allows scientists to determine that timing more precisely, making measurements of the Earth''s rotation and orientation more accurate, NASA officials said.'),
(8007, 3226, 'The new network is called the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS), and it includes several improvements compared with the old network.'),
(8008, 3226, 'One improvement is the size of the dishes. At 39 to 42 feet (12 to 13 meters) wide, the new dishes are significantly smaller than the 65- to 100-foot-wide (20 to 30 m) ones used in the older network. The smaller dishes can move more quickly and do 100 observations per hour, compared with about 12 per hour for the older system. This smaller dish type is also less expensive than the older, larger ones, NASA officials said.'),
(8009, 3226, 'In addition, VGOS can use broadband capability to perform more sensitive observations, thus allowing for more precise measurements with less interference from other radio sources, NASA officials said. It can work in four frequencies (bands) at the same time, allowing data-transfer rates of 8 to 16 gigabits per second (1,000 times the data-transfer rate of HDTV). The older system, by contrast, uses only two frequencies and has a data-transfer rate of 256 megabits per second, NASA officials said.'),

(8013, 3226, 'The testing didn''t come easily. First, NASA and its partners had to overcome several technical problems to make sure VGOS would work correctly. The weather is different at all three sites, making it difficult to account for the effects of a portion of the upper atmosphere (the ionosphere) that interferes with radio waves. The stations also had to work amid interference from radio towers, cell towers and other radio sources.'),

They also can be oriented at any angle in the sky. Some present their spirals full-on to us, and some are edge-on, while many are in between the two positions. Face-on galaxies tend to be dimmer; their total light output may be significant, but it is spread over the maximum possible area. This effect is referred to as low surface brightness. Edge-on galaxies form brighter images in your telescope because the combined starlight is concentrated in a narrow cross section.

Note that those telescopes will not collect enough light for you to see the fainter portions of the galaxies, or to trigger the color receptors in your eye.

This effect is called parallax, and it can be used in astronomy to measure distances. [The Mercury Transit of 2016: How to See It and What to Expect] '),

The distance from the Earth to the sun was poorly known at that time. Astronomer Edmund Halley — of comet fame — was the first to realize that transits could be used to measure the astronomical unit.'),
(8182, 3114, 'The transit technique relies on the precise measurement of the exact moment when Mercury or Venus began moving onto or off of the disk of the sun; two centuries ago, measuring those moments with high accuracy was difficult. Nonetheless, elaborate expeditions to observe the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 provided astronomers with their first good value for the astronomical unit.

Mercury would transit the sun on Nov. 7, followed by Venus on Dec. 6. The sight of a planet passing in front of the solar disk had never been seen before, so Kepler and his soon-to-be son-in-law, Jacob Bartsch, issued an "admonition" to all astronomers to be on the watch for these events. Because Kepler himself was uncertain about the exact circumstances (as he was concerned about the accuracy of his own tables), he urged prospective observers to carefully watch the sun a day early and, should nothing be seen, not give up until the day after. '),

So far, as historians know, only three individuals actually observed the transit of Mercury and only one, Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655), left a detailed account. According to Gassendi''s writings, he observed the transit from Paris, by means of projecting an 8-inch-wide (20 centimeters) image of the sun from his telescope''s eyepiece onto a white screen. At around 9 a.m. local time on Nov. 7, through a scattered-to-broken layer of cloud cover, Gassendi anxiously watched the black dot of Mercury — which was much smaller than he had expected — as it slowly moved across the sun.  '),

It is also one of the first things that doctors will advise you strictly against. Avoid adding extra salt in your food and cease consumption of dishes that have excessive salt.
