He pledged to work toward national reconciliation, strive for peace with warring ethnic rebels and improving the lives of Myanmar''s 54 million people.'),
(58, 1011, 'While it was a historic day for the impoverished Southeast Asian country, democracy remains incomplete. The military retains considerable power in the government and parliament, and the president himself will play second fiddle to Suu Kyi. She cannot be president because of a constitutional manipulation engineered by the military, and has repeatedly said she will run the country from behind the scenes.'),
(59, 1011, '"I am very happy that we have a president who represents people," said Mar Thin, a 50-year-old street cleaner.

(63, 1011, '"Burma will face significant challenges going forward, including achieving broad-based economic development, advancing national reconciliation, and promoting the rights and freedoms of all its people," Mr. Obama said. "The United States looks forward to being a friend and partner of the new government and the people of Burma as they make progress toward building a more inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous future."'),
(64, 1011, 'The U.S. Government has continued, under most circumstances, to refer to the country as Burma as it was the former military junta that unilaterally changed the name to Myanmar in 1989. The U.S. position is that the Burmese people should have been the ones to make the decision on a name change, not the regime. U.S. officials do, however, use the name Myanmar in international venues and in Myanmar itself.'),

(66, 1011, 'Htin Kyaw''s swearing-in was held in an austere hall of parliament, with lawmakers dressed in traditional costume. A few hours later, outgoing President Thein Sein shook hands with his successor and handed him a letter and a golden sash, officially transferring power.'),

(69, 1011, 'Suu Kyi endured decades of house arrest and harassment by military rulers without ever giving up on her nonviolent campaign to unseat them. The constitutional clause that denied her the presidency excludes anyone from the position who has a foreign spouse or child. Suu Kyi''s two sons are British, as was her late husband. The clause is widely seen as having been written by the military with Suu Kyi in mind.'),
(70, 1011, 'She has repeatedly made it clear that she will run the government from behind the scenes, and in his speech on Wednesday, Htin Kyaw paid obeisance to Suu Kyi.'),
(71, 1011, '"The new parliament and new government are formed in accord with the policies of the National League for Democracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi," he said, and referred to the party''s goal to amend the constitution.'),
(72, 1011, '"I have the obligation to work toward achieving a constitution that has democratic norms and is suitable for the nation," Htin Kyaw said.

(73, 1011, 'How has Burma changed since CBS News'' Bill Whitaker was last there in 1990?'),
(74, 1011, 'The constitution, drafted under the former junta, reserves 25 percent of the seats in parliament for military officers, guaranteeing that no government can amend the constitution without the army''s approval. The military also heads the Home Ministry, the Border Affairs Ministry and the Defense Ministry, which gives it control over the corrections department, ensuring that the release of political prisoners is its decision to make.'),
(75, 1011, 'The military also ensured that one of Htin Kyaw''s two vice presidents is a former general, Myint Swe, a close ally of former junta leader Than Shwe. Myint Swe remains on a U.S. Treasury Department blacklist that bars American companies from doing business with several tycoons and senior military figures connected with the former junta.'),
(76, 1011, 'As Htin Kyaw was sworn in, Suu Kyi sat in the front row watching. The same pledge was simultaneously read by First Vice President Myint Swe and Second Vice President Henry Van Tio. After a 20-minute tea break, the 18 members of Htin Kyaw''s Cabinet, including Suu Kyi, took a joint oath of office read out by the speaker.'),
(77, 1011, 'Suu Kyi''s leadership of four ministries is unusual, and the lack of public criticism of her wide power is likely a sign of her continuing broad support.'),
(78, 1011, 'Despite her inability to become president, Suu Kyi''s entry into the government is a remarkable turn of fortune not only for her, but also for the country, which had been under iron-fisted military rule for decades beginning in 1962. The junta kept Myanmar in isolation and economic stagnation while refusing to listen to international counsel or homegrown demands for democracy.'),
(79, 1011, 'Suu Kyi came to prominence in 1988, when popular protests were building up. The junta crushed the protests, which had turned into anti-government riots, killing thousands of people and placing Suu Kyi under house arrest in 1989.'),
(80, 1011, 'The junta called elections in 1990, but refused to hand over power when Suu Kyi''s party won overwhelmingly. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize a year later while under house arrest.'),
(81, 1011, 'The junta finally started loosening its grip on power in 2010, allowing elections that were won by a military-allied party after Suu Kyi''s party boycotted the polls as unfair. Thein Sein, a former general, was installed as president for a five-year term that started March 30, 2011, and ended Wednesday.'),

(88, 874, '"I know I''m not the only one who may be more than a little dismayed about what''s happening on the campaign trail right now -- the divisive and often vulgar rhetoric that''s aimed at everybody but often is focused on the vulnerable or women or minorities," he said.'),
(89, 874, 'Some may be more to blame than others, the president said, but all of us are responsible for reversing it.'),
(90, 874, 'Mr. Obama spoke at the presentation of the Toner Prize, named for Robin Toner, the first woman to be national political correspondent for The New York Times. During her nearly 25 years there, Toner covered five presidential campaigns. She passed away in 2008.'),
(91, 874, 'The president said the number one question he gets when traveling the world is "What is happening in America?" He said it''s because people abroad understand America is the place where you "can''t afford completely crazy politics," and they care about the most powerful nation on earth functioning effectively.'),
(92, 874, '"We are all invested in making this system work. We are all responsible for its success, and it''s not just for the United States that this matters, it matters for the planet," Mr. Obama said.'),

(95, 874, 'Obama called on the broadcast networks and producers to give reporters room to follow their instincts and dig deeper. He said Toner proved that something can be substantive and interesting. He said elections to her were not a horse race, or about scoring the most political points, but were about issues.'),
(96, 874, '"A job well done is about more than just handing someone a microphone. It''s to probe and to question and to dig deeper and to demand more," the president said. "The electorate would be better served if that happened. It would be better served if billions of dollars in free media came with serious accountability, especially when politicians issue unworkable plans or make promises they cannot keep."'),
(97, 874, 'He says he understands there are pressures "to feed the beast" with more gossipy, softer stories, but that leads to consumers failing to understand the world as well as they should, which has consequences for the country.'),

But then, in 2012, NASA dropped out of ExoMars because of budget issues, and ESA had to reconfigure the mission yet again.'),
(207, 426, 'The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, stepped in as a partner and agreed to provide the Proton rockets to get ExoMars off the ground. The Russians contributed some of the instruments in the scientific payload for ExoMars 2016, but the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and the landing capsule Schiaparelli were largely European products, Reiter said.

(208, 426, '"The carrier module and the rover will be built in Europe, but the lander is a Russian product,"Reiter said. "That means that the cooperation between the Russian industry and the European industry will significantly intensify."'),

(221, 426, 'But Mars'' atmosphere isn''t thick enough to slow down spacecraft so that they don''t crash. To put Schiaparelliâand eventually, a rover â on Mars, ESA will use a combination of a heat shield, a big parachute and landing engines, all of which need to work perfectly in a daunting sequence of events that Bayle explained here in a presentation.'),
(223, 426, 'Schiaparelli will separate from TGO three days before reaching Mars. Then, it will go into hibernation mode to save its battery life, only waking up an hour before landing. The heat shield will help the spacecraft withstand temperatures of up to about 3,100 degrees Fahrenheit (1,700 degrees Celsius) as it decelerates from about 12,400 mph to 930 mph (20,000 km/h to 1,500 km/h).'),
(224, 426, 'After about 3 to 4 minutes of this fiery entry, the lander''s parachute will deploy and the front shield will be released. Then, the radar altimeter beneath the lander will measure the spacecraft''s velocity and altitude in relation to the Martian surface below. Using that data, Schiaparelli will decide when it''s time to separate from the parachute and will start firing its landing engines.'),

(226, 426, 'And testing those technologies will be key to sending the much more complicated second mission to land the ExoMars rover and surface platform safely in the Russian-built descent module. What''s more, TGO will be a crucial link in relaying information from the rover back to Earth.'),

(1261, 1168, 'Researchers came close to losing the spacecraft in June 1998, less than three years after launch, after a routine gyroscope calibration. SOHO was in the wrong position to receive communications from Earth, and was not responding to commands.'),
(1262, 1168, 'It took about three months to recover, and the spacecraft lost two gyroscopes as a result. Then SOHO''s last gyroscope failed, forcing mission managers to develop a new way of keeping SOHO stable.'),

(1273, 1168, 'SOHO experienced a "loss of attitude control, subsequent loss of telemetry, and loss of power and thermal control," the board said. This meant that the people on the ground could not control SOHO and could not get any information about its status. Worse, the spacecraft was spinning in such a way that it was being heated unevenly; also, SOHO''s solar panels could not recharge its batteries.'),
(1274, 1168, 'Worried controllers spent a month sending signals to the spacecraft and waiting in vain for a response. In July, they found SOHO by using a large radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. The radar echoes off of SOHO showed the spacecraft was spinning.'),

(1278, 1168, 'Carefully, controllers thawed out SOHO''s frozen fuel inside of its thrusters and recharged the batteries. By mid-September, SOHO was once again pointing in the right direction. Two of the three gyroscopes had failed, but the rest of its instruments appeared to be fine.'),
(1279, 1168, 'On Dec. 21, 1998, however, the last gyroscope broke. Controllers used hydrazine fuel in the thrusters to keep SOHO pointed in the right direction, but they were using quite a bit of it â 15 pounds (7 kilograms) a week, on average.'),
(1280, 1168, 'In January, SOHO controllers changed the spacecraft''s software so that it could operate without gyroscopes and use other tools on the spacecraft to figure out its attitude. This reduced fuel usage and allowed normal observations to continue.'),

(1284, 1168, 'Five years after SOHO''s launch, it was already altering our view of how the sun worked. In 2001, ESA announced that SOHO researchers were giving storm watchers an extra week''s notice of eruption risks. One spacecraft instrument can see through the sun to the backside, while another one can sense activity through ultraviolet emissions.'),
(1285, 1168, 'Also, SOHO saw the sun get brighter as sunspot activity increased, watched gas currents whisk below the sun''s surface, and analyzed the elements coming out of the "solar wind" â the continuous stream of particles from the sun that bleed into space.'),

Astronomers watching with SOHO, however, were astonished to see the pieces briefly brightening before fading away again. Later analysis of the images suggested (although scientists aren''t exactly sure) that the brightness eruption came from the final breakup of the nucleus or heart of the comet.'),

(1456, 294, 'As chief scientist, Stofan holds the most senior science position at NASA. She knew she wanted to be a geologist from an early age. "I was the kid that was always picking up rocks," Stofan said. She disliked math in high school but persevered because she knew she needed knowledge in this subject to become a scientist.'),
(1457, 294, 'Ochoa, on the other hand, loved math â she took her college''s entire series of calculus courses "for fun" â but changed her major "about five times," thinking she might study music or journalism. It wasn''t until she finished the calculus classes that she realized she might like to pursue physics. In her first year of graduate school, she saw NASA launch the space shuttle program and accept the first women astronauts, and later decided to apply for the program.'),
(1458, 294, 'Newman, who holds the second-highest position at NASA, said she wanted to be a "sports lawyer" in high school but gradually found her way to aerospace engineering, largely because she felt space exploration was a way to promote international peace and cooperation.'),
(1459, 294, 'For Roe, a trip to a community college career center during high school made her consider going into engineering.

(1463, 294, '"It''s changed a lot throughout my career," Ochoa said. "It was harder when I was young. In college and graduate school and early on in my career, I was often the only woman in a class or one of two. And I felt self-conscious. I felt like I stood out. It made me a little bit reluctant to raise my hand and ask a question."'),

(1465, 294, '"I don''t really notice I''m a woman in the room, because I''m a member of the team," Roe said. "In electrical engineering and in college, I was often the only woman in the room, and it''s more in hindsight that I remember it. When I was in the room, it might just be a real quick thought, but it didn''t faze me in any way. And within NASA, I''ve always been one on the team. I''ve been one of the people getting the job done."'),
(1466, 294, 'Roe said she''s known women who feel more confident stepping into a job if they have seen another women hold the role before them. However, "I never did," she added. "I never thought about it that way. For me, it really hasn''t been a barrier or anything."'),
(1467, 294, 'Stofan, on the other hand, said her struggle to feel like part of the team had more to do with other people''s isolating comments.'),
(1468, 294, '"Sometimes, especially early in my career, I would feel like I was one of the team and I was just like everybody else," she said. "And then, one of the men would make a comment that would make me stop and think, ''Oh yeah, the rest of the people in the room don''t look like me.''

(1469, 294, '"So, a lot of times, especially early in my career, when I wasn''t self-confident, I would feel like, ''I have to work twice as hard just to be taken half as seriously.'' But as I got more confident, I realized, ''They actually need me here,''" Stofan added.'),

(1828, 354, 'So we (and "we" here means both scientists and the public) have a problem: the knowledge that scientists gain about the natural world stays relatively locked up within the scientific community, the scientists have no incentive to share it more broadly, and the public grows ever more distrustful of scientists.

Maybe if science is shared with them in a way that they can appreciate and enjoy, we can break the cycle of distrust.

(1911, 663, '"I''m a photographer â I like to make photographs, so [early on], it was really about making the photographs, and I hope I exhibit that," Miller said. "And then, I fairly quickly started to realize that this was a fairly unique opportunity I had. And, in part, I felt I had a great responsibility, because I don''t think anyone has photographed at Cape Canaveral as much as I have.'),
(1912, 663, '"And it was obvious from the start that NASA wasn''t going to be able to preserve these sites, because they''re right on the ocean, and the salt water environment [causes things to] rust away," Miller continued. "It''s a constant battle to keep that steel from rusting. So it was pretty obvious these were not going to be sites that could be preserved long-term. So I thought that photography was one way to preserve them and show the evolution of how time affected them."'),
(1913, 663, 'The chapters of the book are divided by era or program, starting with facilities that hosted the early rocket tests, such as the Navaho Launch Complex 9 at Cape Canaveral. Miller''s photos of Complex 9 show vines swallowing up stairways; the weathered paint on a group of electrical panels that has peeled away into a colorful abstract pattern; and massive metal bolts on which lives might have once depended, which are now rusted a deep red.'),
(1914, 663, '"[This work] does show the temporal nature of life," Miller said. "It does show the aging. It does show how something that was once the focus of the world''s attention can, only a few years later, become completely obscure and out of touch with what''s going on contemporarily."'),
(1915, 663, 'Some of Miller''s photographs impart a certain sadness â the locations from which humanity first escaped the clutches of gravity look like ancient ruins. But for the most part, Miller avoids that sadness. Instead, he photographs the structures with great dignity, capturing their awesomeness, even if it lies under a layer of rust and decay. Miller doesn''t forget that these structures and facilities are still examples of great engineering and construction.'),
(1916, 663, '"There are visual references to other archaeological sites, like the great pyramids," Miller said. "I see things that remind me of Mayan ruins, of Greek ruins, of Anasazi Native American ruins in the southwestern United States. There are so many visual references to those types of sites that, once I started seeing [them], I was trying to connect that."'),
(1917, 663, '"Because [the sites in the book] really have become archaeological sites in many ways, and I think, just at a base level, I was just trying to preserve them in this state of their existence," he added. "There are obviously thousands of photographs of these facilities while they were active. I wanted to show how they''ve evolved and what had happened, and I do think there is that sense of loss."'),
(1918, 663, 'Many of Miller''s images try to convey the massive scale of these former launch sites and facilities, and those images cannot help but simultaneously illustrate the desertion that surrounds these locations. There are no cars, no lights on; and weeds poke through the cracked pavement. But more of the images in the book focus on smaller details. They closely examine the decay that is taking place, and frequently capture the unintentional beauty that has arisen from that decay.Â '),
(1919, 663, 'One photograph zooms in on a "plug board" (it looks sort of like an old telephone switchboard, with wires connecting different peg holes in some indecipherable pattern) from the Redstone Launch Complex 26 Blockhouse. It''s framed so that nothing else around it can be seen, and it''s easy to imagine the people who focused so intently on it, and arranged those wires in just the right way. It looks frozen, rather than abandoned, like someone''s hand might move into view at any moment and move one of the cables.'),
(1920, 663, '"I took what I refer to as a dual approach to the subject matter because, at some level, it has to be documentary in nature," Miller said. "There are a lot of overall shots where you see the whole pad or good portion of the structure, but I also wanted to photograph the nuances, the smaller details, the more abstract things, if you will â things you wouldn''t necessarily notice.'),
(1921, 663, '"I think, when people think of a launchpad; they think of the whole thing," he said. "They think of the tower and the mobile service tower, but they don''t really think about the details. So, to tell a fuller story, I made a very concerted effort to [do that]. Plus, there are so many visually interesting things going on when you get down to that detail level. It''s actually one of the unusual things about the project â¦ People tend to do one or the other, not both. And I took some grief at the beginning of the project for doing that, and I''m glad I stuck with it because I think it''s one of the more important aspects of it."'),
(1922, 663, 'Paired with the photographs are essays by Miller, as well as a handful of essays written by people with very different connections to the space program.'),
(1923, 663, '"I approached quite a number of people I knew in the space industry â and I guess it was one of the happy accidents, because these were the folks that responded and said, ''Yeah, I''d like to do that,''" Miller said.'),
(1924, 663, '"I think it actually fit very well with the flow of the book to have an art historian write the introduction and kind of describe the history of space and art," Miller said, referring to Betsy Fahlman, a professor of art history at Arizona State University. Craig Covault, an aerospace journalist who has "covered every U.S. space launch since Apollo," according to a statement from the book''s publisher, wrote an essay about Launch Complexes 40 and 41, two locations that had great significance in the early days of human spaceflight and that have been repurposed for new phases of human spaceflight.'),
(1925, 663, 'Col. Pamela Melroy, a former NASA astronaut and space shuttle commander, penned an essay about Launch Complex 34 for the book. In the essay, she touches on one of the great tragedies of NASA''s human spaceflight program: It was on that launchpad that the Apollo 1 capsule caught fire during a test exercise, killing all three men inside. Melroy mentions in the essay her work on the Columbia reconstruction team â the group tasked with sifting through the wreckage of the shuttle that was destroyed on its way back to Earth.'),
(1926, 663, '"[Complex 34] became a touchstone for her during that very, very difficult work," Miller said. "She came up with a beautiful essay regarding how that site affected her. And I think [her essay] is a tribute to all the fallen astronauts."'),
(1927, 663, 'The book''s title, "Abandoned in Place," is one that resonates with people who visit these old sites. Ray Bradbury wrote a poem about this phrase, and Miller chose to place it at the very beginning of the book. In the poem''s final lines, Bradbury urged, "Old ghosts of rocketmen, arise. Fling up your ships, your souls, your flesh, your blood/Your blinding dreams/To fill, refill, and fill again/Tomorrow and tomorrow wand tomorrow''s/Promised and re-promised/Skies."'),
(1928, 663, 'The book is available for purchase through the University of New Mexico Press, and Amazon.com.'),
(1931, 1176, 'COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. â This week, the 32nd Space Symposium took place in Colorado, but it might as well have been at Cape Canaveral. A virtual-reality app created by United Launch Alliance (ULA) dropped me onto a launchpad next to a Delta IV rocket, and watching it take off gave me nearly the same thrill as seeing a launch in person.'),
(1932, 1176, 'Humans should never actually get as close to a rocket launch as I got to the Delta IV rocket that took off in the VR app. Cameras positioned at three different positions on or near the launchpad captured the explosive column of fire that erupted from the bottom of the rocket, and headphones blasted the booming sound. It was astounding to see the details of the rocket body and the pillar flame up close. Two of the cameras were quickly overwhelmed by smoke, but a third let me look up at the rocket as it became a smaller and smaller point of light overhead.'),
(1933, 1176, 'The VR app is for the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset, which provides a 3D, 360-degree view of the launch, meaning the user can "look around" while the video plays. Even though I knew I was just looking at a video, the responsiveness of the system to the movement of my head quickly suspended my disbelief.'),
(1934, 1176, 'The ULA app is available for download from the company''s website. Users who don''t want to buy a VR headset can use Google Cardboard, which is an assemble-it-yourself cardboard VR headset (smartphone required). It''s obviously less impressive than an actual VR headset, but much, much less expensive.'),
(1935, 1176, 'ULA wasn''t the only booth with a VR experience â Lockheed Martin also had a short VR tour of the facility where the Orion capsule is loaded onto a specially designed airplane called the "Super Guppy." Additionally, Lockheed Martin had a virtual-reality game in which players navigate a Mars rover along the surface of the Red Planet, trying to reach specific locations without tipping over the rover. Another game lets the user walk around a section of the Martian surface. The company is involved in the development of some very advanced virtual-reality tech, and is trying to use VR as part of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education and outreach. However, the programs we saw at the Space Symposium are not currently available to the public.'),
(1936, 1176, 'However, anyone who wants to take a virtual tour of the Red Planet should consider visiting the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex this summer â the facility is opening a new exhibit called "Destination: Mars," in which visitors don VR headsets that give them a 3D, 360-degree virtual-reality view of the surface of Mars, created using real images taken by Red Planet rovers. Plus, the Red Planet tour is led by a VR projection of Buzz Aldrin! In addition, the exhibit will have a space where visitors (wearing the headsets) can walk around, making it seem as though they are really walking around on the surface of Mars.');

(2957, 863, 'Devine told reporters Monday that Sanders has, since Nevada''s caucuses, pursued a "state win" strategy, a move that depends more on winning states outright to get momentum than it does on racking up delegate numbers. But the margins matter a lot here, given the size of the deficit Sanders needs to make up.'),
(2958, 863, 'Because Democrats'' delegates are allocated proportionally throughout the entire primary season, just winning some of these states won''t be enough: Sanders needs to win by massive margins, the same kind of margins he won by in the caucus states last Saturday.

(2960, 863, 'But winning by big double-digit margins in a massive primary state like California or New York is far more difficult than winning by large margins in caucus states, where turnout is much lower.

(2966, 863, 'But there''s a bit of a problem with that argument. Sanders did contest at least some of those states: he campaigned in many of those states, put staff on the ground and even spent money on TV ads.

(3876, 1192, 'The group outlined the technologies it needs to develop and test, none of which are particularly exotic.

(3882, 1192, 'Then there''s the interstellar medium. Space isn''t completely empty, and moving a spacecraft, even a tiny one, through the interstellar and interplanetary medium at a sizable fraction of light speed has never been done.'),
(3883, 1192, '"The interstellar medium isn''t zero," McDowell said, meaning that the probes might hit something.'),
(3884, 1192, 'The Starshot probes would be traveling 4,000 times faster than NASA''s New Horizons Pluto spacecraft, which is the fastest thing that humans have launched to date. At such speeds, colliding with even the smallest bits of matter could be disastrous.'),
(3885, 1192, '"A hydrogen atom moving that fast is a cosmic ray," McDowell said, referring to superenergetic particles accelerated to tremendous speeds by supernova explosions. "Electronics don''t like that."'),

(3888, 1192, 'Furthermore, a particle the size of a sand grain would deliver the same energy to a Starshot probe as a pound (0.5 kilograms) of TNT, potentially destroying the tiny spacecraft entirely, McDowell said. During the Tuesday presentation, Worden said this problem is mitigated by the sheer size and relative emptiness of space, which makes the odds relatively small that the probes will hit anything. In addition, hundreds or thousands of Starshot probes would probably be launched to each interstellar destination, so losing a few wouldn''t be a big deal, team members said.'),
(3889, 1192, 'Another issue will be the acceleration. Starshot probes will be pushed to their cruising speed in about 2 minutes, absorbing a G-force of about 51,000. Electronics are fairly robust, but none have been tested under those conditions, McDowell said. (For perspective, NASA''s Apollo astronauts endured between 3 and 7 G''s when returning to Earth from their moon missions.)'),
(3890, 1192, 'Finally, there are the challenges posed by building a laser big and powerful enough to push the spacecraft to such tremendous speeds. The laser would be a type called a phased array, which involves using lots of lasing elements to create a single combined beam that can be steered without needing a huge mechanical apparatus.'),
(3891, 1192, 'The various elements can also be fired to shape the emitted light waves the laser emits. The technique is common in radar systems, said Starshot advisor Philip Lubin, a physics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has researched building large laser systems.'),
(3892, 1192, '"We can learn a lot from that," Lubin said of such prior research. But he acknowledged that nobody has built a phased-array laser on a Starshot-level scale before.'),
(3893, 1192, 'Lubin said the Starshot array would be composed of thousands of meter-sized (3.3 feet) optical elements and would cover an area approaching several square miles. It would require on the order of 200 gigawatts to operate. That''s 50 times the power generated by the largest nuclear plant in the United States.'),
(3894, 1192, 'However, the laser wouldn''t be firing continuously, and would probably run off some kind of power storage such as a huge capacitor or battery, firing for only a fraction of the time, Starshot team members said. So the power for any given use could be cut to 20 GW, Starshot team members said on Tuesday.'),
(3896, 1192, 'A phased array is attractive because going with a traditional laser would require a single massive optical system, Lubin said.'),

"There was clearly some sort of tectonic activity â things moving around and cracking. There were also places on Europa that look like melt-through or mushy ice."'),
(3948, 1128, 'It is now known that Europa possesses an extensive sub-surface ocean of water, protected by a fragmented, icy crust that appears to move much like the continental plates on Earth. Tidal pressures created during Europa''s orbit around Jupiter create an internal dynamo, which gently heats the moon from the core, maintaining the ocean in a liquid state. In addition, the motion of the icy plates are thought to generate their own heat through frictional processes at the boundaries. Much like the heat produced when repeatedly bending a wire coat hanger, heat is dissipated through the repeated tidal flexing of Europa''s crust at these boundaries.'),

Instead, she realized that the bulk of the heating comes from microscopic defects in the ice''s crystalline structure as the ice was deformed.

[See how the system works in this video]'),
(8005, 3226, 'Specifically, NASA is working on improvements to very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), a technique that allows multiple radio telescopes to work together simultaneously to make more precise measurements.'),
(8006, 3226, 'A signal from a radio-emitting object, such as a quasar (the region around a galaxy''s central supermassive black hole), is collected by several telescopes. Then, researchers calculate the distance between the telescopes by comparing the times at which the radio signal arrived at different receivers. The new system allows scientists to determine that timing more precisely, making measurements of the Earth''s rotation and orientation more accurate, NASA officials said.'),
(8007, 3226, 'The new network is called the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS), and it includes several improvements compared with the old network.'),
(8008, 3226, 'One improvement is the size of the dishes. At 39 to 42 feet (12 to 13 meters) wide, the new dishes are significantly smaller than the 65- to 100-foot-wide (20 to 30 m) ones used in the older network. The smaller dishes can move more quickly and do 100 observations per hour, compared with about 12 per hour for the older system. This smaller dish type is also less expensive than the older, larger ones, NASA officials said.'),
(8009, 3226, 'In addition, VGOS can use broadband capability to perform more sensitive observations, thus allowing for more precise measurements with less interference from other radio sources, NASA officials said. It can work in four frequencies (bands) at the same time, allowing data-transfer rates of 8 to 16 gigabits per second (1,000 times the data-transfer rate of HDTV). The older system, by contrast, uses only two frequencies and has a data-transfer rate of 256 megabits per second, NASA officials said.'),
(8011, 3226, 'NASA''s VGOS dishes are at the NASA-U.S. Naval Observatory VGOS station at NASA''s K?ke''e Park Geophysical Observatory in Hawaii, the Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory at NASA''s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology''s Haystack Observatory.'),
(8013, 3226, 'The testing didn''t come easily. First, NASA and its partners had to overcome several technical problems to make sure VGOS would work correctly. The weather is different at all three sites, making it difficult to account for the effects of a portion of the upper atmosphere (the ionosphere) that interferes with radio waves. The stations also had to work amid interference from radio towers, cell towers and other radio sources.'),
(8014, 3226, '"These and other technical issues have been dealt with," NASA Goddard''s Stephen Merkowitz, manager of NASA''s Space Geodesy Project, said in the same statement. "We have a few more challenges down the road, but they are manageable. We now know that the new global system can be used the way it was intended."'),

He mulled â and by some accounts actually tested â what would happen if two spheres with different weights were dropped at the same time from the Leaning Tower of Pisa.'),
(8022, 3234, 'At the time, the prevailing theory of gravity, developed almost 2,000 years earlier by the Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle, attributed the speed of falling object to its proportional weight, with heavier objects falling faster than lighter ones.'),
(8023, 3234, 'PHOTOS: When the World Went Gravitational Wave Crazy'),
(8024, 3234, 'Galileo believed that mass was immaterial to an object''s falling speed. All would hit the ground at the same time no matter how much they weighed. From that, he deduced that in a vacuum, all bodies would fall at the same speed, an idea that underpins Albert Einsteinâs general theory of relativity, published 100 years ago.'),

Experiments on Earth have been about 100 times less sensitive, mostly because of random, seismic vibrations from naturally occurring and human activities.'),
(8029, 3234, '"We expect to open a new window beyond Einstein," Microscope lead scientist Pierre Touboul wrote in an email to Discovery News.'),
(8030, 3234, 'If the equivalence principle breaks down, the door opens for new physics to complement general relativity, maybe a new type of interaction or a new type of particle for this interaction, he said.'),

(8033, 3234, '"Any violation of the equivalence principle would be of vital importance," the French space agency CNES wrote in a summary of the experiment posted on its website.'),
(8034, 3234, '"It would be the first sign of new physical phenomena â¦ which are not explained by our standard physics model. It would thus bring into question our knowledge at the interface between the field quantum theory and relativity theories of gravitation, as well as the application of these theories to astrophysics and cosmology," CNES said.'),

(8040, 3218, 'But even in a worst-case scenario in which Antares is used only for the NASA work, it will be a good business for Orbital.'),
(8043, 3218, '"There are lots of interchangeable parts and subsystems, with the same engineering and manufacturing teams and facilities," Thompson said. If the vehicle can move beyond NASA to average five or six flights per year, the profit margin thickens, he said.'),
(8044, 3218, 'A flight rate of two or three per year is generally considered exceptionally low for a rocket that must pay its own way in a competitive environment. Orbital isÂ one of three companies providing supply missions to NASA under the Commercial Resupply Services-2 contract, whose launches start in 2019.'),
(8045, 3218, 'The first re-engined Antares uses Russian RD-181 engines for the first stage. They replace an earlier Russian design that Orbital no longer trusted after an October 2014 Antares failure, which was the vehicle''s fifth and last flight.'),

(8088, 3178, 'Galaxies are extremely far away, ranging from a few million to billions of light-years away, so they appear extremely faint despite emitting the combined light of billions of stars. The keys to seeing them include a very dark night sky, away from the city lights and during moonless nights, and a good-size telescope (6 inches and larger to get the best results). A telescope acts as a "light bucket," collecting the photons (light particles) that reach it from the sky, and the wider its lens or mirror, the more photons it will concentrate into your eyepiece.Â '),
(8089, 3178, 'Your peripheral vision is more sensitive to faint light. If you think you have a galaxy in your telescope''s field of view, try directing your gaze to one area and noticing the rest of the field visible in the scope. The averted-vision technique takes a bit of practice, but it works wonders. A gentle tap on the telescope will set a faint object wiggling, rendering it much easier to notice.

Leo hosts a large number of galaxies, a few of which were bright enough to be included in the well-known list of deep sky objectscataloged by French astronomer Charles Messier in the 18th century. Nowadays, the Messier List includes 110 objects, commonly designated by the letter "M" in astronomy apps. Another modern catalog, called the Caldwell Catalog, was designed to catch good objects that Messier missed. Most astronomy apps allow you to search these two lists as well as others.'),

They also can be oriented at any angle in the sky. Some present their spirals full-on to us, and some are edge-on, while many are in between the two positions. Face-on galaxies tend to be dimmer; their total light output may be significant, but it is spread over the maximum possible area. This effect is referred to as low surface brightness. Edge-on galaxies form brighter images in your telescope because the combined starlight is concentrated in a narrow cross section. [Galactic Evolution: How Galaxies are Classified by Type (Infographic)]'),

Amateur-grade telescopes in the 4- to 8-inch aperture range will be able to show you galaxies with visual magnitudes of around 8 to 10. Note that those telescopes will not collect enough light for you to see the fainter portions of the galaxies, or to trigger the color receptors in your eye.

The sight of a planet passing in front of the solar disk had never been seen before, so Kepler and his soon-to-be son-in-law, Jacob Bartsch, issued an "admonition" to all astronomers to be on the watch for these events.

It is also one of the first things that doctors will advise you strictly against. Avoid adding extra salt in your food and cease consumption of dishes that have excessive salt.
